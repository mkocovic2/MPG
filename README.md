# MPG
MPG is a tkinter project built to calculate commuting costs relative to gas prices, miles per gallon, and travel distance.

## Prerequisites
- Python needs to be installed for this program to run.

## How to open
1. Using CMD or an IDE of your choice, open the directory where the "mpy.py" file is located. If you're using CMD, use the cd command to go to the directory where the file is located.
2. Run the "mpg.py"
3. If the program runs successfully, a window will appear for the user to interact with.

# Features
- MPG calculates the cost of travel based on the user's inputs, i.e., miles per gallon, gas cost, and miles traveled.
- If the miles per gallon are unknown, there is an input field that allows the user to find their car's MPG.
